/* Fastpath functions.  These are used in the common case for reading
 * ints where the following conditions are known to be true:
 * (a) the int size is a whole number of bytes (eg. 16, 24, 32, etc bits)
 * (b) the access in the match is byte-aligned
 * (c) the access in the underlying bitstring is byte-aligned
 *
 * These functions are all "noalloc" meaning they must not perform
 * any OCaml allocations.  For this reason, when the function returns
 * an int32 or int64, the OCaml code passes in the pre-allocated pointer
 * to the return value.
 *
 * The final offset in the string is calculated by the OCaml (caller)
 * code.  All we need to do is to read the string+offset and byteswap,
 * sign-extend as necessary.
 *
 * There is one function for every combination of:
 * (i) int size: 16, 32, 64 bits
 * (ii) endian: bigendian, littleendian, nativeendian
 * (iii) signed and unsigned
 *
 * XXX Future work: Expand this to 24, 40, 48, 56 bits.  This
 * requires some extra work because sign-extension won't "just happen".
