   {2 Introduction}

   Bitstring allows you to name sets of fields and reuse them
   elsewhere.  For example if you frequently need to parse
   Pascal-style strings in the form length byte + string, then you
   could name the [{ strlen : 8 : int; str : strlen*8 : string }]
   pattern and reuse it everywhere by name.

   These are called {b persistent patterns}.

   The basic usage is:

{v
(* Create a persistent pattern called 'pascal_string' which
 * matches Pascal-style strings (length byte + string).
 *)
let bitmatch pascal_string =
  \{ strlen : 8 : int;
    str : strlen*8 : string }

let is_pascal_string bits =
  bitmatch bits with
  | \{ :pascal_string } ->
    printf "matches a Pascal string %s, len %d bytes\n"
      str strlen
v}

   or:

{v
(* Load a persistent pattern from a file. *)
open bitmatch "pascal.bmpp"

let is_pascal_string bits =
  bitmatch bits with
  | \{ :pascal_string } ->
    printf "matches a Pascal string %s, len %d bytes\n"
      str strlen
v}

   {3 Important notes}

   There are some important things you should know about
   persistent patterns before you decide to use them:

   'Persistent' refers to the fact that they can be saved into binary
   files.  However these binary files use OCaml [Marshal] module and
   depend (sometimes) on the version of OCaml used to generate them
   and (sometimes) the version of bitstring used.  So your build system
   should rebuild these files from source when your code is rebuilt.

   Persistent patterns are syntactic.  They work in the same way
   as cutting and pasting (or [#include]-ing) code.  For example
   if a persistent pattern binds a field named [len], then any
   uses of [len] following in the surrounding pattern could
   be affected.

   Programs which generate and manipulate persistent patterns have to
   link to camlp4.  Since camlp4 in OCaml >= 3.10 is rather large, we
   have placed this code into this separate submodule, so that
   programs which just use bitstring don't need to pull in the whole of
   camlp4.  This restriction does not apply to code which only uses
   persistent patterns but does not generate them.  If the distinction
   isn't clear, use [ocamlobjinfo] to look at the dependencies of your
   [*.cmo] files.

   Persistent patterns can be generated in several ways, but they
   can only be {i used} by the [pa_bitstring] syntax extension.
   This means they are purely compile-time constructs.  You
   cannot use them to make arbitrary patterns and run those
   patterns (not unless your program runs [ocamlc] to make a [*.cmo]
   file then dynamically links to the [*.cmo] file).

   {2 Named patterns}

   A named pattern is a way to name a pattern and use it later
   in the same source file.  To name a pattern, use:

   [let bitmatch name = { fields ... } ;;]

   and you can then use the name later on inside another pattern,
   by prefixing the name with a colon.
   For example:

   [bitmatch bits with { :name } -> ...]

   You can nest named patterns within named patterns to any depth.

   Currently the use of named patterns is somewhat limited.
   The restrictions are:

   Named patterns can only be used within the same source file, and
   the names occupy a completely separate namespace from anything
   else in the source file.

   The [let bitmatch] syntax only works at the top level.  We may
   add a [let bitmatch ... in] for inner levels later.

   Because you cannot rename the bound identifiers in named
   patterns, you can effectively only use them once in a
   pattern.  For example, [{ :name; :name }] is legal, but
   any bindings in the first name would be overridden by
   the second name.

   There are no "named constructors" yet, but the machinery
   is in place to do this, and we may add them later.

   {2 Persistent patterns in files}

   More useful than just naming patterns, you can load
   persistent patterns from external files.  The patterns
   in these external files can come from a variety of sources:
   for example, in the [cil-tools] subdirectory are some
   {{:http://cil.sf.net/}Cil-based} tools for importing C
   structures from header files.  You can also generate
   your own files or write your own tools, as described below.

   To use the persistent pattern(s) from a file do:

   [open bitmatch "filename.bmpp" ;;]

   A list of zero or more {!named} patterns are read from the file
   and each is bound to a name (as contained in the file),
   and then the patterns can be used with the usual [:name]
   syntax described above.

   {3 Extension}

   The standard extension is [.bmpp].  This is just a convention
   and you can use any extension you want.

   {3 Directory search order}

   If the filename is an absolute or explicit path, then we try to
   load it from that path and stop if it fails.  See the [Filename]
   module in the standard OCaml library for the definitions of
   "absolute path" and "explicit path".  Otherwise we use the
   following directory search order:

   - Relative to the current directory
   - Relative to the OCaml library directory

   {3 bitstring-objinfo}

   The [bitstring-objinfo] command can be run on a file in order
   to print out the patterns in the file.

   {3 Constructors}

   We haven't implemented persistent constructors yet, although
   the machinery is in place to make this happen.  Any constructors
   found in the file are ignored.

   {2 Creating your own persistent patterns}

   If you want to write a tool to import bitstrings from an
   exotic location or markup language, you will need
   to use the functions found in the {{:#reference}reference section}.

   I will describe using an example here of how you would
   programmatically create a persistent pattern which
   matches Pascal-style "length byte + data" strings.
   Firstly note that there are two fields, so our pattern
   will be a list of length 2 and type {!pattern}.

   You will need to create a camlp4 location object ([Loc.t])
   describing the source file.  This source file is used
   to generate useful error messages for the user, so
   you may want to set it to be the name and location in
   the file that your tool reads for input.  By convention,
   locations are bound to name [_loc]:

   {v
   let _loc = Loc.move_line 42 (Loc.mk "input.xml")
   v}

   Create a pattern field representing a length field which is 8 bits wide,
   bound to the identifier [len]:

   {v
   let len_field = create_pattern_field _loc
   let len_field = set_length_int len_field 8
   let len_field = set_lident_patt len_field "len"
   v}

   Create a pattern field representing a string of [len*8] bits.
   Note that the use of [<:expr< >>] quotation requires
   you to preprocess your source with [camlp4of]
   (see {{:http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/Reflective_OCaml}this
   page on Reflective OCaml}).

   {v
   let str_field = create_pattern_field _loc
   let str_field = set_length str_field <:expr< len*8 >>
   let str_field = set_lident_patt str_field "str"
   let str_field = set_type_string str_field
   v}

   Join the two fields together and name it:

   {v
   let pattern = [len_field; str_field]
   let named_pattern = "pascal_string", Pattern pattern
   v}

   Save it to a file:

   {v
   let chan = open_out "output.bmpp" in
   named_to_channel chan named_pattern;
   close_out chan
   v}

   You can now use this pattern in another program like this:

   {v
   open bitmatch "output.bmpp" ;;
   let parse_pascal_string bits =
   bitmatch bits with
   | \{ :pascal_string } -> str, len
   | \{ _ } -> invalid_arg "not a Pascal string"
   v}

   You can write more than one named pattern to the output file, and
   they will all be loaded at the same time by [open bitmatch ".."]
   (obviously you should give each pattern a different name).  To do
   this, just call {!named_to_channel} as many times as needed.

    let field = set_length_int field 8 in
v}
